Run Tests
---------

Assuming you have Chibi Scheme installed, you can run the tests by issuing
the command

  chibi-scheme -Irapid-lib tests.scm

in the main directory. The test suite should work as well with any other
R7RS-compliant implementation of the Scheme programming language although
the exact command-line syntax may differ.
